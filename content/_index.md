    item1: "– what the horse feels on its back?"
    item2: "– which saddle fits better?"
    item3: "– what influence does the saddlecloth have?"
    item4: "– Does the horse react sensitively when galloping because the pressure on the saddle may be different?"
    item5: "– what actually happens if I sit differently?"
    item6: "– how do I optimize my riding?"
    item7: "– Am I not riding over the seat and why do I still have to use the reins?"

    heading: "Our anatomically shaped and very thin saddle mat records the pressure distribution on the horse's back."
    para: "The complex interaction of the force effects between horse, saddle and rider is measured in the relevant riding situations or when standing and later evaluated in the SATS analysis software. It becomes visible in which movement phase and at which points the saddle bears in the saddle position or causes unwanted pressure peaks on the horse's back. Painful duck on the spine is visualized and should be fixed as soon as possible. Numerous analysis tools such as: weight distribution of the rider, center of gravity, mean, maximum value, etc..."

With <a href="https://eberhard-weiss-reitlehrer.de/" target="_blank">Mr. Eberhard Weiß</a> and <a href="https://www.pferdepraxis.co.at/" target="_blank">Dr. Stodulka</a> from the <a href="https://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/" target="_blank">University of Vienna</a> , an anatomy edition MSL (medical saddle gauge) was developed and is offered by us in a modified form. Advantage: the print images are adapted to an anatomical 3D model. You can see the pressure on the associated muscle parts and can evaluate and take measures under medical anatomical aspects! <br>
**Conclusion: The perfect tool for every veterinarian, saddler, physiotherapist, osteopath to form the cause-effect circles, to design healing concepts and to treat them.**
