topLine: 'In the following we briefly go into the handling:'

first:
    para1: "A series of photos shows how easy it is to commission and use the saddle tester system."
    para2: "Before the measuring mat is placed on the horse, it is advisable first 'introduce' the measuring mat to any suspicious characters."
    para3: "By letting the horse sniff the measuring mat, the nervousness of the unknown quickly dissipates and the measuring mat can be placed directly on the animal's back."
    para4: "As you can see in the photo, the measuring mat has the shape of the horse's back and is therefore perfectly positioned."
    para5: "The picture on the left shows two pockets attached to the measuring mat in the lower half."
    para6: "To the left of the horse is the bag with the power supply. It is a battery pack with a battery status indicator. To the right of the horse is the bag with the evaluation electronics and the data radio. "
    para7: "In contrast to the earlier models, the electronics are now completely integrated in the pad and there is no need to carry the electronics in a backpack."

second:
    para1: "Of course, nothing can be seen from the components during use. They disappear into the pockets and are secured by a snap fastener. (see right photo)"
    para2: "The horse should have ridden before the recording. In this case, the measuring pad is put on when you saddle up and the warm-down takes place with the measuring blanket. This is not a problem. It is important to note that when measuring, the horse walks loose on the reins."
    para3: "The degree of assembly is important because in this condition the saddle must fit."
    para4: "In most systems for electronic surveying (usually due to a lack of technical possibilities) this effect is avoided. It is immensely important that the saddle is measured while it is being used."
    para5: "You can read more information about this in the relevant chapters."
    para6: "The mat is placed directly on the horse's back under the usual riding gear. It is important that everything is exactly as it is otherwise ridden."
    para7: "A saddle cloth can and will change the printed image. If a saddle cloth is normally used, this should now also be used."

third:
    para1: "To counteract the transmission of pathogens or fungi between the horses, the measuring pad has a waterproof coating. Cleaning the pad with disinfectants is of course possible."
    para2: "Despite this property, the measuring pad is very thin and cuddly."
    para3: "So that the forces that arise can be detected by the sensors, the forces must also act on the sensors."
    para4: "That is why the sensors are higher than the rest of the measuring ceiling. You can feel the sensors with your fingers in the pad. This prevents damping of the measured pressure distribution and ensures a meaningful print image."
    para5: "The evaluation software offers, among other things, a center of gravity evaluation and a pressure distribution over the entire measurement cycle."
    para6: "Before strapping in, you should therefore check whether the pad is in the middle of the spine and correct it if necessary."

fourth:
    para1: "Now the horse can be saddled again as usual."
    para2: "As you can see in the photo, the attached pockets do not bother stirrups or belts."
    para3: "As far as possible, the measuring system works without disturbing the usual rider-saddle-horse system "

fifth:
    para1: "On the left of the picture you can see the horse in motion, while on the right of the picture the pressure conditions between the horse and the riding gear are examined."
    para2: "Due to the possibility of viewing the images 'live' with the help of the radio link and interpreting them promptly, weak points can be identified during the recording and, if necessary, corrective influence can be exerted."
    para3: "In the picture on the right, the measurement is already in full swing."
    para4: "Often you can already see on the field - without having to retreat to the closet for the analysis - that, for example: the saddle or the pad does not work at all as hoped."
    para5: "Recording the data is often unnecessary in such cases. This gives the dealer the opportunity to quickly test some of the saddles that come into question."
    para6: "It is usually recorded here. For the up-to-date saddle dealer/saddler, the analysis serves to ensure that everything was right when the saddle was handed over."
    para7: "The recordings also provide the saddler with information for optimizing the saddle or pad while moving."
    para8: "But the most important thing is that the rider has the security of having found a functioning and as pleasant as possible interface with his horse while riding."

sixth:
    para1: "In the last picture you can see how the rider gets the effect of her body weight shift visualized."
    para2: "Experience has shown that this illustration helps beginners, but also ambitious advanced riders, to understand the use of weight shifting to communicate with the horse better and, above all, faster."
    para3: "Verbal descriptions of 'do this to bring about this' are replaced with images."
    para4: "The riding instructor can demonstrate the pressure distribution and the riding student can tell the horse where to go by imitating the pressure image." 
    para5: "The system is therefore an excellent means to learn to ride quickly and effectively, but also to make progress faster and more effectively in order to be even more successful at tournaments through better cooperation with your horse - through improved communication."
