### Google Analytics<br>
On the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO) we use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google LLC ("Google"). Google uses cookies.

<br>
Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law ( https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active ).<br>
<br>
Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offer by users, to compile reports on the activities within this online offer and to provide us with other services related to the use of this online offer and internet usage. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created from the processed data.<br>
<br>

<br>

### Google Universal Analytics<br>
We use Google Analytics in the form of “ Universal Analytics ”. "Universal Analytics" refers to a Google Analytics process in which the user analysis is based on a pseudonymous user ID and thus a pseudonymous profile of the user is created with information from the use of different devices (so-called "cross-device tracking"). <br>
<br>

### Target group building with Google Analytics<br>
We use Google Analytics to display the ads placed within the advertising services of Google and its partners only to those users who have also shown an interest in our online offering or who have certain characteristics (e.g. interests in certain topics or products that are based on the visited website). websites are determined), which we transmit to Google (so-called “remarketing” or “Google Analytics audiences”). With the help of remarketing audiences, we also want to ensure that our ads correspond to the potential interests of users.<br>
<br>

### Google Adsense with personalized ads<br>
We use the services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 on the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO). , United States, ("Google").<br>
<br>
Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law ( https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active ).<br>
<br>
We use the AdSense service, with the help of which advertisements are displayed on our website and we receive payment for their display or other use. For these purposes, usage data such as the click on an ad and the IP address of the user are processed, with the IP address being shortened by the last two digits. Therefore, the processing of user data is pseudonymised. <br>
<br>
We use Adsense with personalized ads. In doing so, Google draws conclusions about their interests on the basis of the websites visited or apps used by users and the user profiles created in this way. Advertisers use this information to tailor their campaigns to those interests, which is beneficial for users and advertisers alike. For Google, ads are personalized when collected or known data determines or influences ad selection. This includes, but is not limited to, previous searches, activity, website visits, app usage, demographic and location information. Specifically, this includes: demographic targeting, interest category targeting, remarketing, and targeting on customer match lists and audience lists,<br>
<br>

<br>

### Google Adsense with non-personalized ads<br>
We use the services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 on the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO). , United States, ("Google").<br>

### Google AdWords and conversion measurement<br>
We use the services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 on the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO). , United States, ("Google").<br>
<br>
Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).<br>
<br>
We use the Google "AdWords" online marketing process to place ads on the Google advertising network (e.g. in search results, in videos, on websites, etc.) so that they are displayed to users who have a presumed interest in the ads. This allows us to display ads for and within our online offering in a more targeted manner in order to only present users with ads that potentially match their interests. If, for example, a user is shown ads for products that he was interested in on other online offers, this is referred to as "remarketing". For these purposes, when our and other websites on which the Google advertising network is active are accessed, a Google code is executed directly by Google and so-called (re)marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also referred to as "web beacons") integrated into the website. With their help, an individual cookie, ie a small file, is stored on the user's device (comparable technologies can also be used instead of cookies). This file notes which websites the user visits, what content he is interested in and which offers the user clicked on, as well as technical information on the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting times and other information on the use of the online offer.<br>
<br>
We also receive an individual "conversion cookie". The information obtained with the help of the cookie is used by Google to create conversion statistics for us. However, we only find out the anonymous total number of users who clicked on our ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, we do not receive any information with which users can be personally identified.<br>
<br>
User data is processed pseudonymously within the framework of the Google advertising network. This means that Google does not store and process, for example, the name or e-mail address of the user, but processes the relevant data in relation to cookies within pseudonymous user profiles. This means that from Google's point of view, the ads are not managed and displayed for a specifically identified person, but for the cookie owner, regardless of who this cookie owner is. This does not apply if a user has expressly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected about users is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the USA.<br>
<br>
You can find more information on data use by Google, setting and objection options in Google's data protection declaration ( https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads ) and in the settings for the display of advertisements by Google  (https:// adssettings.google.com/authenticated ).<br>

<br>
We use the Google "Doubleclick" online marketing process to place ads in the Google advertising network (e.g. in search results, in videos, on websites, etc.). Double Click is characterized by the fact that ads are displayed in real time based on users' presumed interests. This allows us to display ads for and within our online offering in a more targeted manner in order to only present users with ads that potentially match their interests. If, for example, a user is shown ads for products that he was interested in on other online offers, this is referred to as "remarketing". For these purposes, when our and other websites on which the Google advertising network is active are accessed, Google immediately executes a code and so-called (Re)marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also known as "web beacons") integrated into the website. With their help, an individual cookie, ie a small file, is stored on the user's device (comparable technologies can also be used instead of cookies).

<br>
The IP address of the user is also recorded, whereby this is shortened within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area and only in exceptional cases is it transmitted in full to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The above information can also be combined by Google with such information from other sources. If the user then visits other websites, he or she can be shown ads tailored to his or her presumed interests based on his or her user profile.<br>
<br>
User data is processed pseudonymously within the framework of the Google advertising network. This means that Google does not store and process, for example, the name or e-mail address of the user, but processes the relevant data in relation to cookies within pseudonymous user profiles. This means that from Google's point of view, the ads are not managed and displayed for a specifically identified person, but for the cookie owner, regardless of who this cookie owner is. This does not apply if a user has expressly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected by Google Marketing Services about users is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the USA.<br>
<br>
You can find more information on data use by Google, setting and objection options in Google's data protection declaration ( https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads ) and in the settings for the display of advertisements by Google  (https:// adssettings.google.com/authenticated ).<br>

### Online presence in social media<br>
We maintain online presences within social networks and platforms in order to be able to communicate with the customers, interested parties and users active there and to be able to inform them about our services there.<br>
<br>
We would like to point out that user data can be processed outside of the European Union. This can result in risks for the user, because it could make it more difficult to enforce the user's rights, for example. With regard to US providers who are certified under the Privacy Shield, we would like to point out that they undertake to comply with the data protection standards of the EU.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, user data is usually processed for market research and advertising purposes. For example, usage profiles can be created from usage behavior and the resulting interests of users. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements inside and outside the platforms that presumably correspond to the interests of the user. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the users' computers, in which the usage behavior and the interests of the users are stored. Furthermore, data can also be stored in the usage profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them).<br>
<br>
The processing of the personal data of the users takes place on the basis of our legitimate interests in effective information of the users and communication with the users in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR. If the users are asked by the respective providers of the platforms for their consent to the data processing described above, the legal basis for the processing is Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter a., Article 7 GDPR.<br>
<br>
For a detailed description of the respective processing and the possibility of objection (opt-out), we refer to the following linked information from the providers.<br>
<br>
Also in the case of requests for information and the assertion of user rights, we would like to point out that these can be asserted most effectively with the providers. Only the providers have access to the data of the users and can take appropriate measures and provide information directly. If you still need help, you can contact us.<br>

### Integration of third-party services and content<br>
We use content or service offers from third-party providers within our online offer on the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit Integrate services such as videos or fonts (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content"). <br>
<br>
This always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the user, since without the IP address they could not send the content to their browser. The IP address is therefore required for the display of this content. We endeavor to only use content whose respective providers only use the IP address to deliver the content. Third-party providers can also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information can also be stored in cookies on the user's device and, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system,<br>

<br>

<br>

### Typekit fonts from Adobe<br>
On the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO) we use external "Typekit" fonts from the provider Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, 4 -6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24, Republic of Ireland.

<br>

### Use of Facebook Social Plugins<br>
On the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO) we use social plugins ("plugins") of the social network facebook.com, which operated by Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook"). <br>
This can include, for example, content such as images, videos or text and buttons with which users can share content from this online offer within Facebook. The list and appearance of the Facebook Social Plugins can be viewed here:  https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/ .<br>
<br>
Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law ( https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&status=Active ).<br>
<br>
If a user calls up a function of this online offer that contains such a plugin, his device establishes a direct connection with the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted directly from Facebook to the user's device, which integrates it into the online offer. User profiles can be created from the processed data. We therefore have no influence on the amount of data that Facebook collects with the help of this plugin and therefore inform users according to our level of knowledge.<br>
<br>
By integrating the plugin, Facebook receives the information that a user has accessed the corresponding page of the online offer. If the user is logged into Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to his Facebook account. If users interact with the plugins, for example by pressing the Like button or making a comment, the corresponding information is sent directly from your device to Facebook and stored there. If a user is not a member of Facebook, there is still the possibility that Facebook will find out and save their IP address. According to Facebook, only an anonymous IP address is stored in Germany.<br>
<br>
The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook as well as the relevant rights and setting options for protecting the privacy of users can be found in Facebook's data protection information:  https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/ .<br>
<br>
If a user is a Facebook member and does not want Facebook to collect data about him via this online offer and link it to his member data stored on Facebook, he must log out of Facebook before using our online offer and delete his cookies. Further settings and objections to the use of data for advertising purposes are possible within the Facebook profile settings:  https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads   or via the US site  http://www.aboutads.info /choices/   or the EU site  http://www.youronlinechoices.com/ .
